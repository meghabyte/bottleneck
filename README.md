# Policy Learning with a Language Bottleneck

Under construction!


This repository contains the code for the paper [Policy Learning with a Language Bottleneck](https://cs.stanford.edu/~megha). In this work, we show how artificial agents that periodically generate and condition on linguistic rules describing their own most rewarding behavior can learn more generalizable policies that enable stronger human-AI interaction. For any questions, please contact megha@cs.stanford.edu!
